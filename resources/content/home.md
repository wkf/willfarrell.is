### On being a developer.
I'm a full-stack (think pancakes) developer and architect at **MojoTech** where I use and teach **Clojure**, **Bash**, and a whole slew of other tools. I automate our **Debian** servers with **Ansible**, and keep our applications running with **Docker**. Lately, I've been working on some open source Clojure projects, like [Aviary](https://wkf.github.com/aviary) and [Hawk](https://wkf.github.io/hawk). This paragraph was happily written in **Neovim**.

### But not *just* a developer.
I live in **Providence** and ride my bike to work. I also make music, sometimes digitally, and sometimes the old-fashioned analog way (with a piano, or a guitar). Calling me a foodie wouldn't be inaccurate. I was **Edward James Olmos** for Halloween (from Stand and Deliver, not Battlestar Galactica). The rest of the time I'm just myself.

### On reaching out.
To see what I've been up to, check out a selection of my work on [GitHub](http://github.com/wkf "Github") (though most of my day is spent on closed source projects). [Email](mailto:yes@willfarrell.is "Email") me to say something privately. Use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wkf "Twitter") to say something publicly.
