I'm a developer. <em>It's Nice.</em></h2></header><main><section><article><h3>On being a developer.</h3><p>I'm a full-stack (think pancakes) developer and architect at <strong>MojoTech</strong> where I use and teach <strong>Clojure</strong>, <strong>Bash</strong>, and a whole slew of other tools. I automate our <strong>Debian</strong> servers with <strong>Ansible</strong>, and keep our applications running with <strong>Docker</strong>. Lately, I've been working on some open source Clojure projects, like <a href="https://wkf.github.com/aviary">Aviary</a> and <a href="https://wkf.github.io/hawk">Hawk</a>. This paragraph was happily written in <strong>Neovim</strong>.</p></article><aside><h4>()</h4></aside></section><section><article><h3>Not <em>just</em> a developer.</h3><p>I live in <strong>Providence</strong> and ride my bike to work. I also make music, sometimes digitally, and sometimes the old-fashioned analog way (with a piano, or a guitar). Calling me a foodie wouldn't be inaccurate. I was <strong>Edward James Olmos</strong> for Halloween (from Stand and Deliver, not Battlestar Galactica). The rest of the time I'm just myself.</p></article><aside><h4>?</h4></aside></section><section><article><h3>On reaching out.</h3><p>To see what I've been up to, check out a selection of my work on <a href="http://github.com/wkf" title="Github">GitHub</a> (though most of my day is spent on closed source projects). <a href="mailto:yes@willfarrell.is" title="Email">Email</a> me to say something privately.
